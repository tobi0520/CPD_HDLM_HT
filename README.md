Robust Change Point Detection for High-dimensional  Linear Models with Tolerance for Outliers and Heavy Tails



We provide the R codes and real data for the leading studies. 

Several files are provided:

1. `Real_data.csv`  is our processed real application data
2. `beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data` were Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Dataset that be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data) and have not been modified.
3. `code_python` is our simulation code contained BSA and DPA.
4. `code_python/test11.ipynb` is test precedure for this paper.



**Note: We will organize the R code based R package and upload it to this repository soon.**
